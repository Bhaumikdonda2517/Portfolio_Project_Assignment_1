                    My name is Bhaumik Donda, and I am an IT student currently studying at Loyalist College, Toronto Campus.
                    I am passionate about technology and problem-solving, with proficiency in programming languages like C, C#, Java, SQL, and MySQL.
                    I thrive on creating innovative solutions to challenges and aim to apply my technical knowledge in real-world scenarios.
                    Eager to grow as a professional, I am particularly interested in software development and exploring emerging technologies to make a meaningful impact.
